# Talkity
#### This is a project of mine using Discord.JS and Node.
#### It allows you to connect to a Discord Bot and send messages in channels with a terminal.
#### ㅤ
#### Edit ./bin/TOKEN.cfg with your bot's token and run the index.js file.
#### Afterwards using Developer Tools in Discord copy a channels ID and use 'setchannel' command to change the channel!

#### I probably won't be updating this that often as its just an easy project overall, however I'll still spend time on it to do QOL changes.
